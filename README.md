"A place to buy and sell reservations to popular restaurants near you"

## Development:

- Once you clone the repository please create a new branch to work in, not the "master"

- Please don't directly merge your changes into the master branch.
  Submit a PR, and allow someone else in the group to review the code and merge.

- Make sure to keep your branch up to date with changes in the master, as changes could affect the way your works.
